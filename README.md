For now, it is a template to create a Kotlin compiler plugin.

In contrary to other templates can be found on GitHub, this one:
1. Contains detailed explanations about each component's purpose and configuration.
2. Doesn't have any additional complications like publishing, CI/CD and other extra configurations.

It's better to clone this repository and open in the IDE, as there are helpful entry-point run configurations.
Start with investigating the **compiler-plugin** module, then check the **gradle-plugin**
and eventually open the **sandbox** as a separate project to see how the plugin's integration works.
